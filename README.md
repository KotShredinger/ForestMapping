# Forest species mapping supported with machine learning.

__Source code for paper Boreal forest species mapping supported with machine learning using spectral, terrain and texture features__

We observed the influence of various feature types, including values of initial bands, vegetation indices, terrain features and texture features on the performance of popular machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Ridge classifier, k Nearest Neighbour, Decision trees, Extra trees and Logistic regression mode. 

Map demonstrate classified forest map by Ridge Regression
